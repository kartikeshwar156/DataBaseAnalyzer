if python --version is not working, 
try py --version

and if py --version is working , you can just download libraries like
pandas using "py -m pip install pandas", if "pip install pandas" is not working
-----------------------------
pip install flask didn't worked, but ' py -m pip install flask ' worked, I was getting error-

Fatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using '"C:\Users\dell\python.exe"  "C:\Users\dell\Scripts\pip.exe" install flask': The system cannot find the file specified.
----------------------------------

for running the python file from root folder,  I used
py Src/App.py
